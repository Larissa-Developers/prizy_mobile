# Prizy

This a WIP for the Larisa Developers Meetup Group.

In a nutshell, the app will give the ability, to the meetup's attendees, to check themselfs in and be part of the the meetup's draw for prizes.

## Requirements

1. [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) (version 8.3 or newer)
2. [Watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/) - if you are on macOS. Watchman is a tool by Facebook for watching changes in the filesystem. It is highly recommended you install it for better performance.
3. React Native cli - [react-native-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-cli)
4. Xcode (to the app run on iOS)
5. Android Studio (to the app run on Android)

## Getting started

### 1. Install node modules

Run `npm install` from root directory

### 2. Run on simulators

1. Start server to serve React Native code
   - `react-native start` or `npm run start`
2. Start iOS simulator
   - `react-native run-ios`
3. Start Android emulator
   - `react-native run-android`
